Hello to my website,
This is my tentative of creating a personal website that is simple, elegant and could be used by anyone interested.
Feel free to grab the code and use for your website as well, if you need help, send me an email at fracazo at gmail.com and I will try to help.
Â© This website was designed and coded by Alex Fracazo (UX/UI Product Designer), would be nice to be recognised by this lines of codes.
